# Des Moines Bike-Sharing System Investment Opportunity

Bicycle-sharing systems have historically been in place in heavy populated cities around the world. It is common to see them in cities like New York City, Los Angeles and Denver but now all major cities around the US and World are implementing this option as an alternative better for the environment transportation mode from one point to the next. I, along with my partner, present to you this investment opportunity for the first bike-sharing system in Des Moines, Iowa. 

Des Moines has become a vibrant cultural mecca of the Midwest with sculpture parks, botanical gardens, and a shopping and dining scene that would rival any larger metropolis. As the capital city of Iowa, Des Moines continues to grow by population as city dwellers look for more affordable places but keep all charm intact.

## NYC Case Study

To identify Des Moines as the next opportunity for bike-sharing system, we did a case study on New York City to see trends and how we would use that information to correlate to our city of interest. In July 2019, the estimated population of Des Moines was 214,237 compared to 8.3 million in New York City or about 3%. There are over 10 other bike-sharing system companies battling it out for riders in New York City while there is currently none in Des Moines. New York City has the population but there are many other options for transportation like the subway and cab and in general if you have been, riding a bike down crowded city street presents a whole other issue. These concerns are not a problem for the city of Des Moines. With a fraction of the startup cost to service Des Moines, we do not have to deal with certain taxes or regulations that New York has implemented. 

We also looked at other metrics like gender and use. From the NYC data, 65% of riders identified as male. Also, over 80% of riders were subscribers which means they pay a monthly rate and that money is collected no matter how many times they ride a bike. This is the profit center attribute. This analysis will lead to a male skewed marketing strategy to implement in Des Moines to target our key demographic and drive subscriptions.

## Des Moines Tourism Segment

We also took a deep dive into the tourism within the region. According to Longwoods International, the Des Moines region welcomed 13.7 million visitors in 2016 which brought in about $838 million in spending.  Activities in this area include brewery visits, festivals/fairs, concerts, museums, and sports which draws the Millennial and Gen X age group of 18-44. This is also the age range where we saw the usership of bike-sharing systems the most utilized. In 2016, 288 events were hosted in the city. Our bike-sharing system marketing tactics would include sponsoring these local events to increase awareness.

## Conclusion

Bike sharing systems have positive economic impact with less traffic congestion, less pollution, and the healthiest option for transport. When tourists are going relatively short distances, it only makes sense to hop on a bike and pedal to your next destination. With low barriers of entry, no competition, a thriving economy and a strong tourism segment, Des Moines is the next opportune city to establish a successful bike-sharing system.
